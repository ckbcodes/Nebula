#RSEngineProject
A simple game engine built in C++.

#Description
RSEngine is a game engine developed by Solomon and Ransford, as our final exam for DCIT314. It offers a variety of features including:

3D Renderer in the edit view
Scene Editor
Keyboard Input capabilities
#Installation
To get started with RSEngine:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Double click on the .sln file to open the project in your preferred C++ IDE.
Make sure to run the project in "DebugEditor" mode. Due to certain optimizations and configurations, the "Release" mode might not run as expected at the moment.
Usage
Once you have the project up and running, you can start building and rendering your 3D models, designing scenes, and integrating keyboard inputs to add interactivity.




Acknowledgments
This project was heavily inspired by a tutorial series by Arash Katami on 3D game programming,as well as tutorials from PardCode. The foundational concepts and certain parts of the codebase are borrowed from the PrimalEngine developed in the tutorial. We opted for this approach due to time constraints and the depth of knowledge provided in the series.

Known Issues
The engine may occasionally crash. In such cases, try rebuilding the project, and it should resolve the issue. We werent able to integrate the renderer entirely but it runs iin RSEnginev1. The sln file can be run to view the renderer
